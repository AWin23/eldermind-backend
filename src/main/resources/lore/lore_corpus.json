    "text": "The Battle of Red Mountain was the climactic battle of the War of the First Council, and resulted in the sudden disappearance of the entire Dwemer race from Nirn.[18][16] The battle was fought at Red Mountain in Resdayn (present-day Morrowind) around 1E 700[19] (or possibly earlier),[nb 1] between the Chimer (led by General Nerevar, the Hortator) and the Dwemer (led by Dumac Dwarfking),[16][20] along with armies of Nords and Orcs.[17][21] The exact truth of what happened cannot be determined due to conflicting accounts,[22] but all agree that by the time the dust settled, much of that dust was all that remained of the Dwemer.[16] Though Nerevar died, his people claimed victory, and four Chimer were positioned to become living gods.[18][16] The First Council was held together for hundreds of years thanks to the friendship between Dumac and Nerevar. However, through means lost to history, Lord Voryn Dagoth of House Dagoth learned of a Dwemer scheme: deep in the bowels of Red Mountain on the island of Vvardenfell, the Dwemer had found the Heart of Lorkhan, and High Craftlord Kagrenac planned to harness it and use it to power a giant mechanical god.[18][16][23] Lord Dagoth reported this to the Chimer leadership, and eventually, the Hortator Nerevar confirmed it with his patron Azura. Nerevar confronted his friend Dumac, and they quarreled bitterly (some sources assert Dumac did not know of Kagrenac's plan at the time and thus misunderstood Nerevar's concerns). As a result, Nerevar led the Chimer to war in order to stop this profane usurpation.[18][16] At the start of the war, Dwemeri forces were concentrated in the northwest of the province, and their campaign initially had great success throughout the north.[17][24] There is speculation that many of the great metal automatons the Dwemer used as troops in the battle were built in the Great Workshops of Nchardak on the island of Solstheim. The coastal Dwemeri city was reputedly able to produce one automaton a day, an apparently impressive rate of production.[25] Many outlanders were at the battle, notably Orcs and Nords, and sources often designate them as allies of the Dwemer.[17] Nerevar, meanwhile, led his united people, the nomadic Ashlanders as well as the Great Houses (House Redoran, in particular, likes to trumpet its substantial contribution of warriors to the battle).[17][26][27] Nerevar did not have full control of the Chimer forces until a series of defeats convinced the Great Houses to relinquish command.[24] Once he had full command of the Chimer forces, Nerevar carefully orchestrated a confrontation at Dumac's citadel, a great Dwemer stronghold within Red Mountain where the Heart was being kept.[17][2] The bulk of Nerevar's troops left Narsis and headed north at roughly the same time as a horde of westerners entered Morrowind from the west and began crossing the Inner Sea.[18][21] Some sources claim that all who opposed Nerevar's forces in the battle were exterminated.[17][24] Others state that while all enemies of the Chimer forces were decisively defeated, only the Dwemer were wiped out completely.[28]",

    "text": "Numidium,[1] also known as Anumidium, Anumidum, the Brass God, the Prime Gestalt,[2] NM,[3] the Brass Tower,[4] Walk-Brass,[5][UOL 1] Big Walker,[6][2] Walking Star,[7] and the Divine Skin,[2] was a colossal construct of Dwemer origin.[8] It was constructed by Dwemeri Tonal Architect Lord Kagrenac[9][10][11] to be a new god, powered by the Heart of Lorkhan,[12] made to retake Resdayn from the Chimer[13] and possibly to make the Dwemer race immortal.[11] The Dwemer vanished from Tamriel before the Brass God could be activated, though their disappearance may be directly related to this endeavor.[11] The Numidium was, in practice, a weapon of devastating power. A 'thousand foot tall automaton, a golem or an atronach[nb 1] of sorts', it was used by Emperor Tiber Septim to complete his conquest of Tamriel at the end of the Second Era, but was destroyed afterward.[14] The golem was rebuilt and reactivated centuries later, and became the center of the phenomenon known as the Warp in the West, after which it was destroyed again.[8] Temporal distortions have accompanied each known use of the Numidium,[6] to the point that the Warp in the West is sometimes known as the 'Second Numidian Effect'.[15] Some believe that the Numidium was intrinsically evil: a ranking Clockwork Apostle refered to it as the 'most profane' of the Dwemer's creations, a 'walking horror', the 'Antipodal-God-Thing that reigned on the darkest pole of the sacred Nirn-Sphere', and the 'welded knot at the center of Anu that must be untied. The Apostles considered the Numidium the greatest threat to Sotha Sil's goals of bringing about the Nirn-Ensuing and the Anuic convergence of Anuvanna'si. Indeed, in the Second Era, the Clockwork City's supervising Factotum, Aios, would name Numidium first among the existential threats to the City.[16][3] A second Numidium, Akulakhan, was partially constructed in Morrowind in the late Third Era by Dagoth Ur. However, the destruction of Kagrenac's enchantments on the Heart of Lorkhan in 3E 427 prevented its activation",
